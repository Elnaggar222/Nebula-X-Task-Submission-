This project is a test task for a front-end developer role at **Nebula-X Company**. It focuses on creating a responsive and visually appealing homepage with several sections, animations, and design techniques. The goal was to deliver a fully functional and polished user interface.

## **Features** 📝

- **Design Tricks**: The homepage was divided into 7 sections for better organization:

  - **Header** 🏠
  - **Hero Section** 🌟
  - **Companies** 💼
  - **Services** 💡
  - **Products** 📦
  - **Our Work** 🖥️
  - **Footer** 🔽

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using:

  - **Flexbox** 🧩: For aligning elements within sections.
  - **CSS Media Queries** 📱: Ensures the page looks great on small, medium, large, extra-large, and XX-large screens.

- **Fonts & Icons**:

  - **Mona Sans Font** 🔤: Used for clean and modern typography.
  - **Font Awesome Library** 🖼️: For elegant icons across sections.

- **Images & Backgrounds**:

  - **Figma** 🎨: Designed custom vector backgrounds for the header, hero section, footer, products, and the "Our Work" section.
  - **SVG Images** 🌐: All background images were exported from Figma as SVGs to ensure scalability and high quality.
  - **Freepik, Remove.bg, Canva, and Pixlr** 🖼️: Used to source and adjust images, remove backgrounds, and improve visuals.

- **CSS Techniques**:

  - **Global Items** 🧰: Used a shared container class for layout consistency across the site.
  - **CSS Variables** 🎨: For consistent use of repeated colors, border-radius, and box shadows.
  - **Reusable Styles** 🔄: Applied shared styles, including button styles and animations across different sections.

- **Animations**:
  - **IntersectionObserver** 👀: Used to trigger animations when elements come into view on the page, enhancing the user experience.

## **Challenges Faced** 🤔

1. **Design Complexity** 💻: The homepage contained numerous design elements that required careful consideration for alignment and responsiveness. Using Flexbox and CSS Grid made it easier to organize the content.
2. **Image Sourcing and Editing** 🔍: Finding and adjusting high-quality images took extra time, as I had to use multiple tools to ensure the visuals were top-notch.
3. **SVG Design and Animation** 🎨: Designing custom SVGs in Figma and implementing them as backgrounds was challenging but rewarding. Additionally, adding smooth animations via IntersectionObserver required attention to detail for performance optimization.

- **JavaScript** 💻
- **Figma (for SVGs)** 🎨
